**Metis Marker** brings you the opportunity to create NATO joint military symbols according to *APP-6(E)*.  
It allows to build symbols from components, including frame, icon, first modifier, second modifier and amplifiers, rather than pre-define all possible symbols.

## Features:
- Full customizable marker
- Moveable marker
- Editable/non-editable marker
- Copy & paste marker
- Save & load marker presets
- Build in preview
- Full 3DEN support
- Full Briefing support
- Communication channel support e.g. Global, Side or Group channel 

## Customizable marker system
Our customizable marker system consists of:  
- **Frames:** The geometric border of a symbol that provides an indication of the standard identity, battle dimension and status of a joint military object. *Currently only ground symbols are supported.*
- **Icons:** The innermost part of a symbol that provides a graphic representation of an object.
- **Modifiers:** A pictorial or alphanumeric component that provides additional information about the icon and are always located inside the frame area.
- **Amplifiers:** Optional text or graphics that provide additional information about a symbol and are always located outside the frame area. This includes:
    - Echelon
    - Reinforced or Reduced
    - Higher Formation
    - Unique Designation
    - Additional Information
    - Date-Time Group (DTG)
    - Operational Condition 
    - Direction of Movement Arrow
    - Headquarters Staff Indicator

## FAQ
- Q: Does the mod have to be run on the server?  
  A: Yes
- Q: Can we get the option to draw control measure symbols (e.g. the attack arrow)?  
  A: No. Here's why:
    1. Arma already provides the ability to draw lines, so you can easily make them.
    2. Creating such a system would be too complex because CMS are very customizable (they can vary in length, width, curvature, etc.). We would need to create a framework similar to 3DEN shapes (I mean the rectangles, etc.) and still add more (you can't curve 3DEN shapes).
- Q: Can I draw markers in the 3DEN editor  
  A: Yes, standard keybind applies (default: right alt).
- Q: Can I draw markers in the mission planning screen?  
  A: Yes, standard keybind applies (default: SHIFT + LMB)
- Q: I can't see markers placed in the 3DEN editor when I'm ingame?  
  A: The mission needs to be saved for the markers to appear ingame.
- Q: Is there an option to change the color scheme of the markers to the Arma vanilla style?  
  A: Yes! In the CBA Settings you can set Metis Marker to use Arma colors instead of the APP-6 colors.
- Q: Where can I find more infos about this mod?  
  A: You can read our [Wiki](https://github.com/Metis-Team/mts_marker/wiki)
